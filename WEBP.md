**The .WEBP file extension refers to the WebP image format, which is a modern image format developed by Google. It is designed to provide high-quality images with smaller file sizes, making it ideal for web use.**

<ins>Here's a detailed explanation of the .WEBP file extension:</ins>

1. Lossy and Lossless Compression: WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces file size by selectively discarding certain image details, resulting in a smaller file size but with a slight loss in image quality. Lossless compression, on the other hand, compresses the image without any loss of quality, resulting in larger file sizes compared to lossy compression.

2. Small File Sizes: One of the primary advantages of the WebP format is its ability to achieve smaller file sizes compared to other common image formats like JPEG and PNG. This is achieved through advanced compression techniques, such as predictive coding and variable-sized blocks, which allow for better compression efficiency without significant loss in image quality.

3. High-Quality Images: Despite the smaller file sizes, WebP images can retain high image quality. The format supports a wide range of color depths, including 24-bit RGB and 32-bit RGBA, allowing for accurate color representation and transparency.

4. Lossless Transparency: WebP supports lossless transparency, allowing for the preservation of transparency information in images. This makes it suitable for use in scenarios that require images with transparent backgrounds, such as logos, icons, and graphics.

5. Animation Support: WebP also supports animation, allowing for the creation of animated images similar to GIF. It provides an efficient way to deliver animated content on the web with smaller file sizes compared to other animation formats.

6. Browser Compatibility: WebP is supported by major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. This broad browser support ensures that WebP images can be displayed correctly on a wide range of devices and platforms.

7. Conversion and Compatibility: While WebP is gaining popularity, it may not be supported by all image editing software or applications. However, many image editing tools, including Adobe Photoshop and GIMP, provide options to convert images to the WebP format. Additionally, there are libraries and converters available to convert WebP images to other formats if wider compatibility is required.

8. Web Optimization: Due to the smaller file sizes, WebP is commonly used for web optimization, where fast-loading images are crucial for improving website performance and user experience. The reduced file sizes result in faster page loading times and reduced bandwidth consumption.

**In summary, the .WEBP file extension represents the WebP image format, developed by Google. WebP files offer smaller file sizes compared to other common image formats while retaining high image quality. They support both lossy and lossless compression, transparency, and animation. WebP is widely supported by major web browsers and is commonly used for web optimization to enhance website performance.**
